        "question": "How do I mint an IM NFT?",
        "answer": "You will be able to mint an Internet Made NFT on <a href='/'>www.internetmadenft.com</a> website. When you click the mint button you will be redirected to our minting subpage. If you have our whitelist role, you will need to whitelist your Ethereum erc20 wallet (such as MetaMask) address, only then you are able to participate in the presale. Public sale will be open to everyone.<br><br>We are constantly listening to our community and adjusting our roadmap to best serve all of our IM NFT holders. Our vision continues to evolve based on the input of our ecosystem, and in the future we'll have staking and DAO infrastructure available for our NFT holders."

        "question": "How can I get whitelisted?",
        "answer": "Because we want to create a genuine and close-knit community, we donâ€™t give WL roles for leveling on discord. We have a worldwide moderation team which is giving out WL roles to people who are genuinely interacting with others, making fan-art & contributing to the IM community."
